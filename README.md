Title: The Amazie Synth

WDI Final Project 2017

This project was created through React, React Three Renderer and Three. It is meant for individuals who would like to entertain themselves by playing on a fun and interactive 3D piano using the computer. It allows you to play in 3 different octave ranges of the keyboard and has the ability to zoom, rotate and move from left to right. The keys also light up as you play with a music note moving according to the key being played.
